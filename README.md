## Refactor Calculator API with MVC Pattern and Object-Oriented Programming

This sample demonstrates how to refactor the calculator API with MVC (Model View Controller) pattern and object-oriented programming. The refactored code uses Domain Object to represent business logic, Data Access Object (DAO) for data access, Data Mappers to convert between Domain Object and Data Transfer Object (DTO), and controller to coordinate workflows. The refactored code improves separation of concern and is more modular and maintainable.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v16 or above
